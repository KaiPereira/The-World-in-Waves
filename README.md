# The World in Waves

*A technical explainer of the entire electromagnetic spectrum and how waves actually work.*

Have you ever actually taken a moment to think about the invisible waves just travelling through the empty space around you. Let's start off with a really simple question, what actually is an electromagnetic wave?

The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses the full range of electromagnetic waves, separated by bands, from lowest to highest frequency: radio waves, micro-waves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma-rays.

What's interesting is that all these waves in all of these bands, have different characteristics of how they're produced, how they interact and how we use them.

I've split up this technical explainer into chapters. Each chapter will go into depth about their specific band of waves, and I've also provided a brief overview of what a wave actually is below!

But before we dive into individual bands, we need to understand the mathematics that describe how waves actually work.

Electromagnetic waves are oscillating electric and magnetic fields. You might be wondering why sound waves aren't part of the electromagnetic spectrum, they're waves too right?

Sound waves are fundamentally different, they're what we call longitudinal waves which differ from transverse waves which make up electromagnetic waves.

As you can see, a longitudinal wave oscillates back and forth like a slinky, creating compression's and rarefaction's (a rarefaction is the opposite of compression, it's the spreading out of waves). Your ear captures these vibrations, amplifies it using your bones (wow), and then converts the mechanical vibrations into electrical signals for your brain.

On the other hand, transverse waves are a bit more complicated. Their electric field is oscillating in time, which means when you place a charged particle in that field, it feels a force, making the particle move back and forth causing it to oscillate. The particle's motion is a response of the field, not actually the field itself.

This is where it get's really interesting though, how are these waves actually moving forward? You see, a changing electric field actually creates a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field, creates an electric field. This means each changing field will generate the other slightly ahead in space, and this pattern will sustain itself and propagate. 

But how do you actually start this chain reaction? It's actually really simple, you just need to accelerate an electric charge. You see:
- A stationary charge will create a static electric field
- A charge at a constant velocity will create a steady electric and magnetic field
- But a charge that's accelerating will create changing fields that can sustain the self-propagating chain reaction

Now what properties do these transverse waves have?

First of all you have frequency, which describes how fast the fields are oscillating at a fixed point. Frequency is the fundamental property that determines the electromagnetic wave.

Next, you have the wavelength, which is the distance between repeating points of the wave. As frequency increases, the wavelength will decrease, they are inversely proportional. If the speed increases while the frequency remains the same, the wavelength will increase because the oscillations are covering a larger distance!

Finally you have the amplitude of the wave which determines the maximum strength of the electric and magnetic field. The energy of the wave is directly proportional to the square of the amplitude, so double the amplitude, means 4 times the energy. *This is really interesting in many cases, for example if the seismic waves of an earthquake have larger amplitudes, they'll have much more destruction*. 

Particles in an EM wave with a larger amplitude will feel a strong force proportionally. But this doesn't mean waves with a higher amplitude will last longer, that depends on other factors like pulse length and medium, it's just the maximum strength of the oscillation.

And just like that, you should now have a basic understanding of what an electromagnetic wave actually is. Feel free to go onto the next sections, but if you want to stick around, I'll talk more about some of the more complicated aspects of electromagnetic waves. 

So we understand what actually makes up waves, but how do these properties manifest the unique behaviors across the electromagnetic spectrum?

Well, this is the whole point of the separate chapters, but essentially as you go down the bands, you get higher frequency, shorter wavelengths and more energy per photon.

But wait, where do photo's come into play here? Photon's are actually the fundamental quanta of the electromagnetic fields. The energy of these photon's depends on the frequency of your wave, so that's why higher frequency waves like x-rays and gamma rays carry enough energy to ionize atoms and even damage your DNA!

This is really interesting because it shows that at a quantum level, electromagnetic waves are acting as waves but also as particles depending on how you're observing it. This is called wave-particle duality. It's really useful because we can use photon's to explain things that classical waves just can't fully describe. So while they're not really relevant for low-frequency waves like radio, you'll see how they become more relevant for high-frequency waves like x-rays and gamma rays!
