# The World in Waves

*A technical explainer of the entire electromagnetic spectrum and how waves actually work.*

Have you ever actually taken a moment to think about the invisible waves just travelling through the empty space around you. But let's start off with a really simple question, what actually is an electromagnetic wave?

The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses the full range of electromagnetic waves, separated by bands, from lowest to highest frequency: radio waves, micro-waves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma-rays.

What's interesting is that all these waves in all of these bands, have different characteristics of how they're produced, how they interact and how we use them.

I've split up this technical explainer into chapters. Each chapter will go into depth aboute the 

But before we dive into individual bands, we need to understand the mathematics that describe how waves actually work.

Electromagnetic waves are oscillating electric and magnetic fields. You might be wondering why sound waves aren't part of the electromagnetic spectrum, they're waves too right?

Sound waves are fundamentally different, they're what we call longitudinal waves which differ from transverse waves which make up electromagnetic waves.

As you can see, a longitudinal wave oscillates back and forth like a slinky, creating compression's and rarefaction's (a rarefaction is the opposite of compression, it's the spreading out of waves). Your ear captures these vibrations, amplifies it using your bones (wow), and then converts the mechanical vibrations into electrical signals for your brain.

On the other hand, transverse waves are a bit more complicated. Their electric field is oscillating in time, which means when you place a charged particle in that field, it feels a force, causing the particle to move back and forth causing the particles to oscillate. The particle's motion is a response of the field, not actually the field itself.
