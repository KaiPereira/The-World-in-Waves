# The World in Waves

*A technical explainer of the entire electromagnetic spectrum and how waves actually work.*

Have you ever actually taken a moment to think about the invisible waves just travelling through the empty space around you. But let's start off with a really simple question, what actually is an electromagnetic wave?

The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses the full range of electromagnetic waves, separated by bands, from lowest to highest frequency: radio waves, micro-waves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet, x-ray and gamma-rays.

What's interesting is that all these waves in all of these bands, have different characteristics of how they're produced, how they interact and how we use them.

I've split up this technical explainer into chapters. Each chapter will go into depth aboute the 

But before we dive into individual bands, we need to understand the mathematics that describe how waves actually work.

Electromagnetic waves are oscillating electric and magnetic fields. You might be wondering why sound waves aren't part of the electromagnetic spectrum, they're waves too right?

Sound waves are fundamentally different, they are what we call longitudinal waves instead of electromagnetic waves which are transverse waves.
